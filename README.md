# docker-php8.3-mariadb-nginx
<p>This is for running php on docker-windows</p>
<p>-I really don't remember if i make the /app directory</p>
<p>-build the image PHP image with php dependencies with: docker-compose build</p>
<p>-build the container with the networks with: docker compose up</p>

Firstly i was trying with an rc mariadb version, but it was difficult i couldn't manage errors, so it works with with mariadb:10
